				<h3><strong>Q1).What is Blue Berries?</strong></h3>
					<p>Ans:Blue Berries is a free stock photo platform.
					My image library includes thousands of high-resolution, royalty-free images that 
					were shot by our global community of photographers. I built Blue Berries to provide 
					designers, developers, bloggers and entrepreneurs with access to beautiful 
					free stock photography. You can use our pictures for just about anything — 
					your website, blog or online store, school projects, Instagram ads, facebook 
					posts, desktop backgrounds, client work and more. All our photos are free for 
					commercial use with no attribution required</p>
				<br />	
					
				<h3><strong>Q2).Do I need to credit the site or photographer?</strong></h3>	
					<p>Ans:My photographers appreciate getting credit for their work because it helps 
					   share their photography with more people, so I’d encourage you to do so whenever possible.
					   You can give credit by linking back to the original photo page or the photographer's Burst
					   profile (e.g. “Photo by Matthew Henry from Blue Berries”). </p>
				<br />			
					  
				<h3><strong>Q3).Can I edit, crop or resize  photos?</strong></h3>
					<p>Ans:Yes, you’re welcome to crop, resize, add text and filters, or otherwise modify our 
					   stock photos as you see fit. If you don’t have Photoshop, there are lots of free or low cost online graphics editors that you can use instead.
					   Feel free to add your logo or brand to our images to make them your own.</p>
				<br />
				
				<h3><strong>Q4).Are these photos free for commercial use?</strong></h3>
					<p>Ans:Yes! In fact, I’ll highly encourage it, as many of our collections were created with entrepreneurs in mind. You can use these free photos 
					   on your online store, product packaging, or anywhere else you’d like. You can even use these pics to create t-shirts, mugs, or other products.</p>
				<br />	  
					  
				<h3><strong>Q5).Can I use these pictures for another online store platform?</strong></h3>
					<p>Ans:Yes! I believe in making commerce better for everyone, so these stock photos are free to use on any online store platform or ecommerce marketplace.
					   Although they were specifically created and curated with Shopify stores in mind, it’s really up to you how you want to use them.</p>	
				<br />	  
					  
				<h3><strong>Q6).Can I use these photographs for offline marketing campaigns?</strong></h3>
					<p>Ans:Of course. I’ll be honored to have you feature our free stock photos on a billboard, flyer, menu or catalog.</p>
				<br />	
					
				<h3><strong>Q7).I’d like to contribute photos. What types of images should I submit?</strong></h3>
					<p>Ans:We’re looking for high-resolution, professional images that can be used by designers, developers, bloggers and entrepreneurs.
					   Our users are always eager for more pictures of animals, nature photos, textured shots and background images. If you think it’s a compelling 
					   photograph, please send contact me through <strong>About Me</strong> block in navigation bar.</p>
